### Break Down of the Units:

- Unit 1: Crash Course in Python. I only cover enough python to give students the ability to use numpy arrays and pandas dataframes, and read a for loop.
  - Approx. length: 3 hours of class time for the notes and 1 hour for the exercises. Not project this unit. 4 total hours; much shorter if this isn't your first coding class.

- Unit 2: Intro to Probability. I blend probability and statsitcs together in a single example. This unit assumes no previous exposure to probability/statistics.
  - we also conlude by buidling a model with pymc, although students are not expected to understand that model yet.
  - Approx. length: 6 hours for the notes. 2.5 hours for exercises, and 3.5 hours for the project. 12 total hours

- Unit 3: Playing with Probability Distributions. Through several examples, we explore different types of probability/randomness, what priors and likelihoods are, and how to check our models
  -  More comentary/examples with pymc woven in.
  -  Approx. length: 2 hours for notes, 3 hours for exercises, and 6 hours for the project. 11 total hours
 
-  Unit 4: Hierarchical Models. An introduction to hyper priors, and how we can use them to make a model with partially dependent groups.
  - Guess at length: 4 hours for the notes, 3 hours for exercises, and 3.5 hours for the project. 10.5 total hours

- Unit 5: Linear Models (1 predictor). How to use one set of data to predict another, and all the perils therein. We cover a lot of single variable generlized linear model concepts.
  - Guess at length: 6 hours notes, 4 hours for exercies, and 5 hours for the project. 15 total hours.

- Unit 6: Linear Models (multiple predictors). Linear models, except more than 1 predictor. Under/Overfitting, model/variable selection, and visualizing high dimensional models.
  - Guess at length: 3.5 hours class time, 1.5 hours for exercises, and 5 hours for the project. 10 total hours

- [Sorta Ready] Unit 7: Fitting Curves. Polynomial regression, b splines, and Gaussian Processes. Also: how all those relate on a continuum, and discussion on where Neural Networks lie on that continuum.
  - Guess at length: 3 hours class time, 1 hour for exercises, and 4 hours for the project. 8 total hours

- [Not ready] Unit 8: Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART). A bayesianification of random forests. I'll cover probabilistic decison trees and pure random forests as well.
  - Guess at length: 8 hours total

- [Not ready, possibly will drop form course] Unit 9: Miscellaneous Methods with PyMC. Mixture models, Zero Inflated models, Out of Sample data.
  - Guess at length: 3 hours total, 1 hour exercises

- [Not ready, possibly will drop from course] Unit 10: An Intro to Markov Chain Monte Carlo. Walk through a Metropolis-Hastings example, More Advanted model Diagonstics.
  - Guess at length: 1.5 total hours

- [Not ready] Unit 11: The Multi-Layer Perceptron. Introduces MLPs as a speedy approximation of a guassian process.

- [Not ready] Unit 12: Priors and neural networks. Introduces dropout, CNN, and transformers as priors.

- [Not ready] Unit 13: Other Modern Machine Learning Methods. I've to cover a modern implementation of k-means called UMAP here, but we'll see if there's time.
  - Guess at length: ? total hours 

Units 9 is optional. It contains useful techniques and concepts, but I probably wouldn't want to devote a whole project to it. 
Unit 10 would really just be a class period or two covering the basic concepts of MCMC and related ideas. Also no project.
